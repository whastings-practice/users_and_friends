# Users & Friends

This project implements a basic social sharing network. Users can connect
to other users by creating "friend circles" (e.g. "Best Friends", "Coworkers").
Users can also create posts and select which friend circles can see each one.

This is a practice Rails app for [App Academy](http://appacademy.io), used
for learning user authentication, complex model associations, and nested forms.

**Other Features**:

- Allows users to reset passwords by email via a secure token.
- Allows user to add shared links to each post they create.
- Displays to each user a feed of all posts that other users have shared with her based on her inclusion in their friend circles.
